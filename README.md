# Timeboard Local

A version of [Timeboard](https://github.com/max8539/timeboard), a web app for storing times and displaying a leaderboard at events, which runs entirely in a web browser. 

Note that unlike the full version of Timeboard, times and settings are stored locally in the web browser. They are not uploaded to any server, and cannot be accessed by others.

A Github-pages deployment is coming soon...
